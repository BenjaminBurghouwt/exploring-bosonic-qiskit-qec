Exploring Bosonic Error Correction with Bosonic Qiskit

This repository contains the code used for a school project. The codebase was developed to implement and validate the concepts discussed, as well as to serve as an educational introduction to Bosonic Error Correction.

A significant portion of the code in this repository is based on the work from [bosonic-qiskit](https://github.com/C2QA/bosonic-qiskit).
